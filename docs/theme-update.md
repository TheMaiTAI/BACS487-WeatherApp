# UI Theme Update: Accessibility & Visual Enhancement

## Overview
The Weather App UI has been updated with a focus on accessibility standards while maintaining an attractive visual experience. The new design uses WCAG-compliant color contrasts, enhanced visual effects, and a consistent theming approach.

## Accessibility Improvements

- **UI Components**: Dark backgrounds with 70% opacity provide sufficient contrast
- **Interactive Elements**: Green gradient buttons with dark text (11:1 contrast ratio)
