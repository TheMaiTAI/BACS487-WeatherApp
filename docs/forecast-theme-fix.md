# Forecast Page Theme Compatibility Update

## Overview
The forecast page has been updated to properly support both light and dark themes. Previously, the forecast page had hardcoded color values that did not adapt to the selected theme, causing inconsistencies in appearance when switching between themes.

## Issues Fixed

### Color Inconsistencies
- **Forecast Cards**: Previously used fixed background colors that didn't match the theme
- **Text Colors**: Text remained dark in light mode but was difficult to read in dark mode
- **Weather Icons and Details**: Detail elements had hardcoded colors instead of theme variables
- **Unit Toggle**: Temperature unit toggle had fixed styling that didn't match the theme

### Duplicate Styles
- Removed duplicate `.weather-section` style definitions that were conflicting with each other
- Consolidated temperature display styling to use theme variables

## Implementation Details

### CSS Variables
- Replaced all hardcoded colors with theme variables:
  - `--content-bg` for backgrounds
  - `--text-color` for main text
  - `--text-secondary` for less prominent text
  - `--border-color` for borders
  - `--box-shadow` for consistent shadow effects
  - `--nav-hover-bg` for hover states

### Enhanced Interactions
- Added subtle hover effects to forecast cards
- Improved transition animations between themes
- Enhanced accessibility with proper contrast in both themes

### Responsive Improvements
- Reinstated mobile layout fixes that were accidentally removed
- Added better overflow handling for hourly forecast on small screens

## Results
- Consistent experience between light and dark modes
- Enhanced readability with proper text contrast
- Seamless theme transitions without jarring color changes
- Improved visual hierarchy that maintains both aesthetic appeal and usability
