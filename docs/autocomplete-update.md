# Location Search & Autocomplete Update

## Overview
The Weather App now supports international location search, allowing users to search for weather information for any location worldwide, not just limited to the United States.

## Changes Made

### Functional Changes
- Removed country restriction (`country=US`) from the Radar.io API calls
- Modified zip/postal code handling to accept international postal codes
- Updated OpenWeatherMap zip code endpoint to handle international postal codes
- Improved display formatting to handle locations without state/province information

### User Interface Improvements
- Updated the search input placeholder to indicate worldwide location support
- Improved location result display for international addresses
- Enhanced error messages to be more relevant for global searches

## Technical Implementation
The changes include:
1. Removal of the `country=US` parameter from the Radar.io API autocomplete endpoint
2. Modification of the location format to handle international address formats
3. Dynamic handling of location components (city, state, country) based on availability

## API Details
The implementation continues to use:
- Radar.io for location autocomplete and geocoding
- OpenWeatherMap for weather data and reverse geocoding

## Future Improvements
Potential enhancements could include:
- Country-specific postal code validation
- Support for addresses in non-Latin scripts
- Default location based on user's browser language/region
- Option to specify units based on country conventions (metric/imperial)
