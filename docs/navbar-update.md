# Sidebar Navigation Update

## Overview
The navigation system has been updated to use a left-side sidebar instead of the traditional horizontal navbar. This change improves usability and provides a more modern look for the Weather App.

## Changes Made

### Visual Changes
- Converted horizontal navbar to vertical sidebar on the left
- Added a gradient background with modern styling
- Improved spacing and typography for better readability
- Enhanced hover and active states with subtle animations
- Positioned the Weather App home button at the top of sidebar

### Technical Improvements
- Fixed horizontal scrolling issues with `overflow-x: hidden`
- Optimized layout for both desktop and mobile devices
- Improved mobile responsiveness with better toggle button positioning
- Used flex layout to ensure proper text alignment
- Added active state highlighting for current page

### Responsive Behavior
- Sidebar takes full width on mobile devices and transforms to top navigation
- Adjusted content padding to accommodate the sidebar on larger screens
- Mobile toggle button properly positioned for better usability

## Implementation Details
The changes were implemented by:
1. Modifying the `navigation.js` component structure
2. Adding custom CSS styles in `style.css` for the sidebar
3. Adjusting content padding to work with the sidebar layout

## Future Improvements
Potential future enhancements could include:
